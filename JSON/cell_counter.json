If this mark exists, make sure that the probe is aligned properly so that it is functioning at maximum capacity. If the device does not have a marking to indicate the neutral home position, place an empty sample collection container in the appropriate position as if the device were to run a test, and verify that the probe is in a position so that it can draw up the entirety of the contents of the sample collection container.",
